# Hi, I'm Lucas!

I've been a tech enthusisast all my life. Started with c# when I was around 13 and then became decently good at web development, slowed down 16, and now back at full steam now that I'm 18. My interests are expanding faster than I can keep up and it's kind of a problem... I'm trying to learn and do so many things in parallel to the rapidly expanding tech landscape that I'm not becoming proficient at anything. I'm having fun though, and that's what matters right!

I'm a big fan of open source projects. Apart from my Jetbrains IDE's all of my applications are open source - Blender, AnythingLLM, Ollama, Zed, Iina, just to name a few. I've also recently taken up Linux, and it's completly changed the way I look at and use computers. I used to have this false idea that Linux was reserved only for individuals with advanced technical knowledge, and as such I stayed far far away. Until I actually tried it - an easier install process than Windows and, in my opinion, a far better experience. It honestly baffles me people still use Windows. 

I'm currently pursuing software development as my major. I want to build software for physical products to engaging real-world testing, and as such, will likely specialize in self driving vehicles. I am also considering engineering.
